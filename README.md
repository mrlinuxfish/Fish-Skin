# FishNew Osu! Skin Project

This is my new skin project where I will be making all osu skin files from scratch.

If you find this skin project helpful, feel free to use any of the assets in your own skin (please give credit if you release a skin using a substacial portion of these assets).

## TODO ##
- Update spinner graphics
- Update score graphics
- Acquire good hitsounds
- Update yellow color so it is not too similar to green

## Changelog: ##
- In process of making core gameplay elements
- Added a lot of new assets
